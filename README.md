# alchitry-learning-module

Storage for Alchitry FPGA introductory coding exercises as I learn my way through them. I make effots to explain what happens in each module, but I am learning this as I go so if you require deep understanding of FPGAs or Alchitry, I suggest you find another source!

## Progression

1. [Your First FPGA Project](/modules/your-first-fpga-project/)
2. [Synchronous Logic](/modules/synchronous-logic/)
3. [IO Element](/modules/io-element/)
4. [Serial Interface](/modules/serial-interface/)
5. [ROMs and FSMs](/modules/roms-and-fsms/)
6. [Hello YOUR_NAME_HERE](/modules/hello-your-name-here/)
7. [Register Interface](/modules/register-interface/)
8. [DDR3 Memory](/modules/ddr3-memory/)

## reference

For the purposes of long-term continuity, I store all articles of the frankly outstanding [Alchitry Tutorials](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/) as PDF downloads in this repo. This is to simplify working in a local-only development environment, and for continuity over the longest term possible. No copyright infringment is intended nor implied by this, all copy is done in the spirit of free-use, and I do not imply through this that the resources are my own.
