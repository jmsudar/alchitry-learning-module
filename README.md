Storage for Alchitry FPGA introductory coding exercises as I learn my way through them.

## reference

For the purposes of long-term continuity, I store all articles of the frankly outstanding [Alchitry Tutorials](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/) as PDF downloads in this repo. This is to simplify working in a local-only development environment, and for continuity over the longest term possible. No copyright infringment is intended nor implied by this, all copy is done in the spirit of free-use, and I do not imply through this that the resources are my own.
