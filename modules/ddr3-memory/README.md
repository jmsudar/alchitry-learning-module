## Purpose

Learn the basics of DDR3 memory

## Success

You can complete the LED demonstration in the README

## The Work

On a Windows or Linux machine, basically not Mac as it can't run Vivado, create a new project starting with the `DDR3 Base Project`. This will have a lot of red errors until the Vivado modules build.

For the final version of this, you will also need to add an `LRU Cache` from within the `Memory` section of the Component library.

Unlike other versions, I am not going to try and explain the work being done here, at least not yet, as I don't fully understand it yet. This is complicated stuff and I will expand on this at another time.
